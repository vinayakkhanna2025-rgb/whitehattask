Why I want to join WhiteHats:
I want to join WhiteHats to learn more about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and how to protect systems from real-world attacks. I am interested in improving my technical skills and learning from experienced members.

Recent cybersecurity news/incident:
I recently read about phishing attacks where attackers send fake emails with malicious links to steal user credentials. This shows how important user awareness and secure systems are.
